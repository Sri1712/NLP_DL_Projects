# Customer Churn Prediction Web App

A **Customer Churn Prediction** application built with **TensorFlow** and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**. This end-to-end project predicts the probability that a customer will churn based on their profile data and allows users to interact with the model in real-time.

## 💻 Project Overview

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn. The app takes user input for various customer features and outputs the predicted churn probability.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time prediction via interactive web interface
- Proper preprocessing of categorical and numerical features
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Geography)
- Standard scaling for numerical features
- Model persistence using Keras and Pickle for deployment
