1️⃣ Exclude your virtual environment (using .gitignore)

Git ignores files based on a .gitignore file. You usually want to ignore virtual environments because they’re OS-specific and can be recreated.

Common virtual environment names

Add one of these (or whichever you’re using):

# Python virtual environments
venv/
.env/
.env/
.venv/
virtualenv/

How to add .gitignore in VS Code

Open your project in VS Code

In the Explorer panel:

Right-click → New File

Name it .gitignore

Paste the entries above

Save the file

✅ If the virtual environment was never committed, this is enough.
