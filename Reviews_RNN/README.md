# Excluding Virtual Environment from Git

This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.  
Virtual environments are **OS-specific** and can be easily recreated, so they **should not be committed to Git**.

## Common Virtual Environment Names to Ignore

Add one of the following (depending on your setup) to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# Python virtual environments
venv/
.env/
